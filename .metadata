Currently buggy and expected to change however. \n- [strike]Includes a custom Argonian codex tab with a few selections of Argonian-focused lorebooks. [/strike]\n\nCustom codex tab is now included in an extra supplimental mod availiable here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=813797002\n\n[h1]Credits:[/h1]\n\nSabboth Ochoa for the original mod and his amazing sprite work and the permission to use it.
