# ArgonianRaceRedux
Argonians for Starbound 1.0

This is an update and continuation of the amazing work by Sabboth with the original 
Argonian Race Mod. The goal of this mod is to get as close to 100% parity with the vanilla races as possible. It's fairly close.

If you've fixed a bug I don't know about, or developed a cool feature that might be worth merging, please feel free to contribute. If I've died and havn't been responsive anywhere for months, feel free to take over the mod, just provide credit to Sabboth and I.
