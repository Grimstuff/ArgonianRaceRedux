# ArgonianRaceRedux
Argonians for Starbound 1.0

An update and continuation of the amazing work by Sabboth with the original Argonian Race Mod. The goal of this mod is to get as close to 100% parity with the vanilla races as possible. It's fairly close.

This github copy is mostly an upload for archival reference and cloning if someone happens to want to mod or develop something for it. I do not use github for development, so if you do have a need to contact me it would best be done through the Steam Workshop page.

As for permissions; complete copies and reuploads of the mod are not allowed as per the origional creator's permissions, mods are allowed and highly welcome. However if I've died and havn't been responsive anywhere for months, feel free to take over the mod, just provide credit to Sabboth and I.
