      "For generations, the Dark Elves enslaved my people, some suffering from hatching to grave under Elven control. During this time, the Nords did nothing to help us. The so-called Empire has not redressed these past offenses.

Instead, we've been told to be happy we are no longer slaves. We've been told recompense is out of the question. But even a guar will bite if kicked long enough.",
"If the Empire will not help us get what we deserve for our generations of suffering, others will help us.

The Varakun seek power for their master, but also grant power to those who serve them. Through their auspices, I will avenge those who died as slaves. I will raise their tormentors as my undead vassals, and they will serve me forever in death."
